# SensorDetection
Made with Android Studio. Simple example of working with Android device sensors. The app code allows you to turn on the "torch" feature, see a list of all sensors on each device, use a custom recycler view item click to see the details of each sensor, and a simple working example of seeing sensor output. The sensors used were 
atmospheric pressure, air temperature, magnetif field strength, gravitational field strength, and relative humidity.
